Project Description
The project involves the development of a comprehensive retail and distribution software product aimed at enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of retail operations. This software will integrate various aspects of retail management, including inventory management, sales processing, customer relationship management (CRM), supply chain management, and analytics. The goal is to provide retailers with a powerful tool to streamline their operations, improve customer experience, and drive sales growth.
Key features of the product will include:
    • Inventory Management: Real-time tracking of stock levels, automated reordering, and inventory forecasting.
    • Sales Processing: Efficient point-of-sale (POS) systems, order processing, and payment integrations.
    • CRM: Customer data management, personalized marketing, and loyalty programs.
    • Supply Chain Management: Vendor management, order fulfillment, and logistics tracking.
    • Analytics and Reporting: Comprehensive dashboards and reports for data-driven decision-making.

Project Tech Stack
To build this software, the following technologies and tools will be used:
    • Front-End:
        ◦ React.js
        ◦ Redux for state management
        ◦ HTML5, CSS3, and SASS for styling
        ◦ Webpack for module bundling
    • Back-End:
        ◦ Node.js with Express.js framework
        ◦ RESTful APIs for communication
        ◦ GraphQL for efficient data querying
        ◦ MongoDB for a NoSQL database
    • DevOps:
        ◦ Docker for containerization
        ◦ Kubernetes for container orchestration
        ◦ Jenkins for CI/CD pipelines
        ◦ AWS for cloud hosting and services (EC2, S3, RDS)
    • Other Tools:
        ◦ Git for version control
        ◦ JIRA for project management and issue tracking
        ◦ Confluence for documentation and collaboration
        ◦ Slack for team communication

Product Ecosystem
The product ecosystem will include the following components:
    • Retail Management System: The core application for managing all retail operations, accessible via web and mobile interfaces.
    • Mobile Apps: Native mobile applications for Android and iOS for on-the-go management and customer engagement.
    • Integrations: APIs and webhooks for integrating with third-party services such as payment gateways, e-commerce platforms, and logistics providers.
    • Partner Portal: A portal for suppliers and vendors to manage their products, orders, and communication with retailers.
    • Customer Portal: A portal for customers to view their purchase history, track orders, and manage their accounts and loyalty points.

Real-time Tracking of Stock Levels
    1. Design Database Schema for Inventory Management
        ◦ Design the database tables and relationships for tracking inventory, including tables for products, stock levels, transactions, and locations.
    2. Develop Inventory Tracking API
        ◦ Create RESTful APIs for CRUD operations on inventory data, including endpoints for adding, updating, and retrieving stock levels.
    3. Implement Web Socket for Real-time Updates
        ◦ Implement WebSocket connections to push real-time inventory updates to the front-end whenever stock levels change.
    4. Create Front-end Components for Inventory Display
        ◦ Develop React components to display current stock levels, including filters and search functionality.
    5. Integrate Barcoding/QR Code Scanning
        ◦ Develop functionality to support barcode or QR code scanning for quick updates of stock levels using mobile devices or dedicated scanners.
    6. User Authentication and Authorization
        ◦ Implement user roles and permissions to ensure only authorized personnel can update stock levels.
Automated Reordering
    7. Design Automated Reordering Logic
        ◦ Develop the business logic for automated reordering, including minimum stock level thresholds, reorder quantities, and supplier information.
    8. Develop Reordering API
        ◦ Create APIs to manage reorder settings and trigger reorder actions, including endpoints for setting reorder thresholds and viewing reorder history.
    9. Integrate with Supplier Systems
        ◦ Implement integrations with supplier systems to automate the reorder process, including API calls to place orders and track their status.
    10. Develop Notification System
        ◦ Implement a notification system to alert users when stock levels fall below thresholds and when reorders are placed and fulfilled.
    11. Create Front-end Components for Reordering Management
        ◦ Develop React components to manage reorder settings, view reorder history, and track reorder status.
Inventory Forecasting
    12. Design Forecasting Algorithms
        ◦ Develop algorithms to forecast future inventory needs based on historical sales data, seasonality, and other relevant factors.
    13. Develop Forecasting API
        ◦ Create APIs to generate and retrieve inventory forecasts, including endpoints to view forecast data and adjust forecasting parameters.
    14. Implement Data Collection for Forecasting
        ◦ Set up data collection mechanisms to gather sales data, inventory changes, and other relevant metrics required for accurate forecasting.
    15. Create Front-end Components for Forecasting Visualization
        ◦ Develop React components to display forecasted inventory needs, including charts and graphs for visualizing trends and projections.
    16. User Training and Documentation
        ◦ Create user manuals and conduct training sessions to educate users on the new inventory management features, including real-time tracking, automated reordering, and forecasting.
Testing and Quality Assurance
    17. Develop Unit Tests for Back-end APIs
        ◦ Write unit tests for all back-end APIs to ensure they function correctly and handle edge cases.
    18. Perform Integration Testing
        ◦ Conduct integration testing to ensure that all components of the inventory management system work together seamlessly.
    19. Conduct User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
        ◦ Organize UAT sessions with key stakeholders to validate that the system meets all business requirements and user expectations.
    20. Deploy Inventory Management Features
        ◦ Deploy the new inventory management features to the production environment and monitor for any issues.
